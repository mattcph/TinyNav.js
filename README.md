Changelog

mattcph - see fork for commit details.
All the new code is still free, and comes with lots of hacks and improvements for real world usage.

v1.1.mattcph (2013-09-01) - dom object for injection, active/inactive options, preferred active for selector ,)

v1.1 (2012-11-14) - Adds an optional "label" tag before the "select" tag, thanks to [@larcher](https://github.com/larcher)

v1.05 (2012-10-19) - Adds the support for multiple navigation depths, thanks to [@nicoandrade](https://github.com/nicoandrade)

v1.04 (2012-10-19) - Adds the possibility to change the text of the header. Notice that there seems to be a bug in jQuery 1.8.0 which prevents this script from working correctly if there is no selected item in the navigation (the plugin does work with older and newer versions correctly though, currently tested up to 1.8.2).

v1.03 (2012-03-15) - Adds new option called "header", thanks to [@jorde](https://github.com/jorde)

v1.02 (2012-03-07) - Some performance improvements and a bug fix

v1.01 (2012-01-04) - Code Refactoring

v1.00 (2011-12-31) - Release
